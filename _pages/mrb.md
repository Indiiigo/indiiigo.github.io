title: "Measurement and Representation Biases in Digital Trace Data-based Studies"

{% include base_path %}

This reading-based seminar will cover the latest research on using digital trace data from web and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Wikipedia and others to measure social phenomena such as political attitudes and health behaviours. It will be centred around readings and discussions to understand how representation and measurement errors can creep into research studies using this type of data in conjunction with large-scale computational and data-driven models. The course will also cover methods to quantify and mitigate these errors and demonstrate how to design valid and reliable research studies. 

The course assessment will be based on a presentation and final report of a chosen reading (60%), on weekly critiques of other papers (40%), and a bonus of 10% for implementing a part of one or more of the discussed papers.
