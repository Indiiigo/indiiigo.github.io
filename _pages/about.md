I am a Computational Social Scientist working on building theory-driven and robust methods for measuring social constructs from digital trace data. I currently work as a postdoc and lecturer at the University of Konstanz in the Department of [Politics and Public Policy](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/). Before, this I did my doctoral studies at RWTH-Aachen and GESIS, Leibnitz Institute for the Social Sciences at the [Computational Social Science (CSS) Department](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/departments/computational-social-science). I'm fortunate to have been advised by Prof. Claudia Wagner and Prof. Wil van der Aalst at RWTH. Through natural language processing and measurement theory, my research focuses on how researchers and policy-makers can draw better and more transparent insights from digital trace data.

Before my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master's in Computer Science from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), working with Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru at Precog, where I was also a research assistant. And even before that, I did my Bachelor's (also in CS) at Vellore Institute of Technology.
